# PearlHash development checkpoints

## v0.0.2-cpu-reference

Download: [Linux x86_64 CPU validation package](releases/pearlhash-dev-v0.0.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz).

This is an offline CPU oracle/reference checkpoint, not a GPU miner. Includes compiled CPU verifier, source, official-generated V2/V3 synthetic fixtures, independent Python math checks, dependency notices, internal checksums, and the original standalone Git history bundle.

Archive SHA-256: `83083651ac353030caea92e8790149402184d639b34c7c54b950a1a17420aef6`.

Compiled and tested on the development host. Debian rig execution pending. No CUDA compilation, GPU test, custom-miner pool acceptance or performance gain is claimed. The ordinary CPU executable makes no network connections. Build dependency downloads are separate.

Validation: seven Python tests; Rust test covers both proof versions plus modified-header/opening rejection and a tiny-target rejection. Exact version behavior is checked against intermediate seeds/transcripts/digests; easy-target fixtures are not evidence of production mining performance.

The source under this subdirectory uses its own ISC license. No XMRig files or live rig settings are modified by this checkpoint.
